# AdvancedTopics-Week3

## Major Info (TLDR)

### Goals:

The goals for this week were to work with styles and themes, specifically Material3, to create a
style template that I actually liked, to be used in future apps

### Problems Encountered

#### Problem 1: Applying a shape appearance to a custom button

##### Status: Unsolved

I would like to make my custom buttons be less rounded than they are. I tried doing this with a
shape appearance, as mentioned in the docs. However, while changing the cornerFamily property (
rounded, cut) works, tweaking the cornerSize property does not seem to do anything. This means I can
have either completely rounded corners, or completely cut.

### App Completion Status

This proof of concept is fully half complete.

### Tools and Resources

#### Color Tool

#### Material3 Docs

## Other Information

This app, I feel, looks great. Much better than the default style. Becuase of my newly aquired style
skill, I can finally say I no longer have such a grudge against button, becuase these buttons look
and act great, and even visually respond to clicks

The biggest improvement to my skills this week is not my work with styles, however. Instead, it was
learning how to read documentation. I can say that this is the first time I have ever used any form
of documentation for any programming task, and it was wonderful. Not to mention that the Material3
docs are fantastic, once you start using them.
